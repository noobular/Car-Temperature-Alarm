# Car Temperature Alarm/Monitor
This is a program created to be used on an Arduino Circuit Playground board, It utilizes the temperature sensor and GPIO's to send out a signal to a relay, wired to your car window if the temperature is above the set "alarm" temperature, it will send power to the GPIO, and when its wired to a window will lower it based on the temperature in the car, as the temperature increases the GPIO will keep recieving power, to lower them, Or if wired to an air conditioning, could regulate temperature in that fashion.
